<h3>E-Business</h3>
<ul>
<li>Empowering mothers out of poverty</li>
</ul>
<p>
In all poor communities, girls and women bear the brunt of poverty. When families struggle with getting enough food to eat, or earn enough money to send their children to school, it is always the girls who find the last to eat and first to be kept home from school. In some communities like Jinjang, the girls will be the target of vices, especially if they are not able to find jobs to help sustain their families. In families with many children, the mothers struggle with finding jobs, as they still have very young children who need to be taken care of, at home. Unable to leave the home or join the work force, they remain destitute and helpless. When you empower a woman, she can become a catalyst for positive change, whose success can benefit the family and even her community.
</p>

<p>
In this E-Business, we empower mothers with the resources to work and earn a living without sacrificing their time with the family.
